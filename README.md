# Ugani_Author_Website

Welcome to the official project for a website of Timna Tlustos, author of the compelling memoir **UGANI** chronicling her childhood in Africa. Timna offers a unique perspective on life, drawing from her experiences growing up in Tanzania among the Sangus people.

In 1997, Timna's family embarked on a mission to Tanzania, driven by her parents' desire to document the native language, traditions, and folklore of the Sangus community. Timna, then just six years old, provides a candid and insightful account of daily life, navigating both the joys and challenges of living among the Sangus.

Through Timna's narrative, readers gain a glimpse into the cultural intricacies and spiritual encounters that shaped her upbringing. Her story is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the transformative power of faith in the face of adversity.
Join Timna on her journey as she shares her perspective on childhood, faith, and the extraordinary moments that define her story. Discover the richness of African culture and the universal themes of love, family, and spirituality woven throughout her memoir.
