| AW03     | 3         | 1    | 6h              | Placeholders where not practical in many instances, as the final design could only be made visible with the final content. |
| AW04     | 2         | 3    | 6h              | See above                                                                                                    |
| AW05     | 3         | 2    | 4h-pending      | Place allocation for content has taken a lot of time. So far only the main page and book subpage has been implemented |
| AW06     | 3         | 2    | 10h             | Color und Design schemes took a lot of time with the initial homepage. For the subpages this work has been incredibly shortend, as what works has already been established. |
| AW07     | 3         | 1    | 2h - pending    | Links to all subpages and parts of the pages have been very easy to place. All links work well and there have been little to no hickups. |
| AW08     | 5         | 3    | 4h -pending     | As i had to teach myself the skill necessary to make this work, it took me a very long time.                  |
| AW09     | 5         | 2    | 6h              | As i had a lucky break with a scientific study i found on the usangu plains, i was able to get the information faster than assumed. |

| AW11     | 5         | 3    | 8h              | Teaching myself the necessary skills has taken way longer than actually implementing the form. Only the design will be inplementend into the final website presentation. As a hosting service is not to be involved until summer. |
